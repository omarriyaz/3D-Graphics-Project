## Treasure Chest
No colouring/texture/materials added. Loop-cuts and faces inserted and extruded to create the wooden planks of the chest. Low-poly and cartoonish style inspired from game Sea of Thieves.

## Sky - Scene
Used the blob sculpting tool on a sphere that was split in half to create low-poly cloud effect. 
The sky material was created using Blender's built in sky texture node - increased ozone property to exaggerate the blueness of the sky. Placed point light in top left and increased light radius.
