README for Final Render

# Scene - Ocean
Added ocean modifier onto pane objecet to mock ocean waves. Decreased the hue of the ocean colour to be more distinctive to the sky colour.

# Scene Lighting
Added 2 area lights - one to slightly light up the entire scene so the 'ozone' property of the sky would be a darker blue instead of light blue. Another to the ship deck so that the modeled objects would not be casted in shadows which affects the view and colour of the materials.

A sun light point was added into the scene, with its strength attribute increased, so all scene contents were brighter in the rendered image - looked too dark / dimly light in earlier versions.

Sun orientation attribute on sky pane was added to the top right corner of the image - introduces more natural feeling sun light.

# Ship Deck
- Removed side ship deck faces so cannon would not clip through ship deck siding.
- Extruded the edges on ship flooring to create 'wooden plank' effect instead of it all being one meshed object.
